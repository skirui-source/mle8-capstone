American Sign Language (ASL) Classifier using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)

By: Sheilah K. (@skirui-source) 


The Sign Language MNIST data sourced from Kaggle  ---- is a database of American Sign Language hand gestures that has been curated 
for multi-class classification using convolutional neural networks

The data stored in .csv format represents 28x28 grayscale images as rows of labels 0-25 (first column) and pixel values 
1-784 (remaining columns). Total 24 labels represent 1:1 mapping for letters A-Z, excluding cases for 9=J and 25=Z which require hand 
gesture motion. 

training and test data contain 27,455 and 7172 images respectively.  



Details of the complete Data Lineage process is outlined below:
